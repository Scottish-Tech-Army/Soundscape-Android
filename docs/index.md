# What is Soundscape?
Soundscape is an Android app to help people with visual impairment explore and navigate the world. It does this by describing nearby features using mapping data from OpenStreetMap.

The initial release is based on the original [iOS Soundscape app](https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/soundscape). We are now at the point where we can publish openly on the Play Store, though we will be continuing to work on and improve the app based on user feedback.

# Soundscape in your language
We aim to support as many languages as possible and so we have started using the fantastic [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/soundscape-android/) to help with the localization of the app. We started off supporting the same languages as supported in iOS, but we have some new strings in the Android app and so there are some missing translations in most languages. All help in adding these, or indeed adding new languages will be gratefully received. A description of how this works can be found [here](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/translating.html). When you set up a Weblate account, you choose which languages you can translate to and if the Soundscape app doesn't currently support that language, you will have the option of adding that language on the main app [page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/soundscape-android/android-app/).
