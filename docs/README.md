## Project aim
The project is creating an Android version of the original [iOS Soundscape app](https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/soundscape). The app aims to help people with visual impairment explore and navigate the world.

## For users
We now have a fairly complete app which has the majority of the features available that are in the iOS app. It's been in internal testing and we hope to soon have the app available for Beta testing which means that it will be openly available on the Google Play Store.

## For developers
Documentation for developers is available [here](developers.md).

## Localization
We have started using the fantastic [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/soundscape-android/) to help with the localization of the app. We started off supporting the same languages as supported in iOS, but we have some new strings in the Android app and so there are some missing translations in most languages. All help in adding these, or indeed adding new languages will be gratefully received. A description of how this works can be found [here](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/translating.html). When you set up a Weblate account, you choose which languages you can translate to and if the Soundscape app doesn't currently support that language, you will have the option of adding that language on the main app [page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/soundscape-android/android-app/).
