## Project aim
The project is creating an Android version of the original [iOS Soundscape app](https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/soundscape). The app aims to help people with visual impairment explore and navigate the world. 

## For users
We now have an app which has many of the features available which are available in the iOS app. It is still relatively early days in the project, but we have started initial user testing taking place via the Google Play Store. Currently this is 'internal' testing which means that to access the app you're name needs to be on a list of approved testers. If you're interested in helping us with testing please use this [contact form](https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/contact-us) and we'll add you to the list.

## For developers
Documentation for developers is available [here](developers.md).
