# Audio Beacon

## What is it?

Setting a beacon on a nearby location allows Soundscape to keep you informed by playing an audible beacon sound coming from the direction of that location. This beacon can be muted or unmuted on the home screen. Additionally, Soundscape displays information about the location on the home screen including the distance to it and its street address if it is known.

## When would I use it?

Setting a beacon is useful when you want to keep track of a familiar landmark as you explore a new area or when you are going somewhere and want to be informed about your surroundings along the way. The beacon feature does not give you turn-by-turn directions, but it does give you a continuous audible sound that tells you the direction to the beacon, relative to where you are currently located. Using the audio beacon, your existing wayfinding skills, and even your favorite navigation app, you can choose how you want to get to nearby locations yourself.

## How does it work?

<b>To set a beacon</b>:<br/> First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar to search for a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", "Saved Markers", or "Current Location" buttons and selecting a location. From the location details screen you can select the "Start Audio Beacon" button. Tapping this will return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you selected. The name of the place you have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will now be displayed on the main app screen.

<b>To remove the current beacon</b>:<br/> Simply press the "Remove Beacon" button on the home screen.

<b>To mute the audible beacon</b>:<br/> Tap the "Mute Beacon" button underneath the "Remove Beacon" button on the home screen.

# Voices

Soundscape can use any of the voices you have downloaded in the iOS Settings app except for the Siri voices which are not available to Soundscape. We recommend choosing one of the "Enhanced" voices as they have a much higher voice quality, but in order to do so, you will first need to download an enhanced voice. You can download voices in the iOS Settings app by going to Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices and tapping on a voice. Within the Soundscape app, you can select the voice you want to use by going to Settings from the main menu and then selecting "Voice".

# Using Media Controls

## What is it?

You can access certain features in Soundscape with the help of the media control buttons on your headphones. This functionality works with any wired or Bluetooth headphones that have media control buttons like Play, Pause, Next, Previous and others. Different headphones may include different buttons so please refer to the list of actions below to determine which ones are available to you.<br>Also note that this feature only works with headphones that support Apple's media controls (such as play and pause).

## When would I use it?

Headphone media controls can be used while Soundscape is running. This is true whether you are currently in Soundscape or while Soundscape is in the background and even while your device is locked. Note however that headphone media control buttons will not work with Soundscape if you are playing audio like music, podcasts or videos with another app.

## How does it work?

<p>You can access the following features in Soundscape using your the media control buttons on your headphones:<p><br>&#x23EF Play/Pause: Mute any current callouts and if the audio beacon is set, toggle the beacon audio. </p><p>&#x23ED Next: Callout <em>"My Location"</em>.</p><p>&#x23EE Previous: Repeat last callout.</p><p>&#x23E9 Skip Forward: Toggle callouts On and Off.</p><p>&#x23EA Skip Backward: Callout <em>"Around Me"</em>.</p>

# Ahead of Me

## What is it?

The <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button tells you about four things ahead of you. <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> is intended to help you explore the way ahead of yourself when you are learning about a new area.

## When would I use it?

When you are walking down the street, try using <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> to discover the places and things coming up on either side of the street ahead.

## How does it work?

As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply, tap the <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button and you will hear several points of interest all roughly ahead of you.

# Around Me

## What is it?

The <em>"Around Me"</em> button tells you about one thing in each of the four quadrants around you (ahead, to the right, behind, and to the left). <em>"Around Me"</em> is intended to help you orient yourself to your surroundings.

## When would I use it?

When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use <em>"Around Me"</em> to hear about the things around you.

## How does it work?

As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the <em>"Around Me"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply, tap the <em>"Around Me"</em> button and you will hear four points of interest arranged around you.

# Automatic Callouts

## What is it?

Soundscape can tell you about things around you as you approach them by calling out their name from the direction they are located in. The app will do this automatically for all sorts of things like businesses, bus stops, and even intersections. You can configure what the app automatically calls out in the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" screen, and you can turn all callouts off when you want the app to be silent.

## When would I use it?

<b>Exploring a new area</b>:<br/> Turn automatic callouts on and walk around to hear about all of the different stores, restaurants, and the like as you pass them.

<b>Walking to a specific location</b>:<br/> When you are on your way to a particular location, automatic callouts for intersections can be particularly useful. Intersection callouts tell you about the layout of intersections as you approach them, and confirm the road you are on when you leave them.

<b>When you need silence</b>:<br/> When you are about to cross a road or just need the app to be quiet, you can turn callouts off. When callouts are off, the app will only tell you information if you manually tap one of the <em>"My Location"</em>, <em>"Nearby Markers"</em>, <em>"Around Me"</em>, or <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> buttons.

## How does it work?

<b>Turning callouts on or off</b>:<br/> Turning callouts off will silence the app. Callouts can be turned on or off in the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" screen where you can tap the "Allow Callouts" toggle to turn callouts on or off. You can also turn callouts on or off by using the "skip forward" command (double tap and hold) if your headphones have media control buttons. Alternatively, you can use the "Sleep" button in the upper right hand corner of the home screen to stop Soundscape from making callouts until you choose to wake it up again.

<b>Managing which callouts you hear</b>:<br/> To choose the types of things Soundscape will automatically callout, go to the "Settings" screen using the menu on the "Home" screen. The "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" screen contains a list of types of things the app can callout. Each item has a toggle button that you can turn on or off. If you wish to turn off all callouts, tap the "Allow Callouts" toggle at the top of the list.

# My Location

## What is it?

The <em>"My Location"</em> button quickly gives you information that helps you figure out where you currently are. <em>"My Location"</em> tells you about your current location including things like the direction you are facing, where nearby roads or intersections are, and where nearby points of interest are.

## When would I use it?

<em>"My Location"</em> is useful when you need to figure out where you are or what cardinal direction you are facing.

## How does it work?

As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the <em>"My Location"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply, tap the <em>"My Location"</em> button and listen.

# Routes

## What is it?

Routes are a series of waypoints. You will be informed on arrival to each waypoint, and the Audio Beacon will automatically advance to the next waypoint.

## When would I use it?

You may want to create and use a route somewhere you know to make sure you keep on track, or you may want to use it as a tool to help familiarise yourself along a new journey.

## How does it work?

<b>Creating a route</b>:<br/> First, go to "Markers & Routes", select the "Routes" tab, and then select the "New Route" button. Give the route a name and an optional description, then add waypoints as you go or pick them from your list of Markers. You can rearrange the order of the waypoints along a route at any time by editing the route.

<b>Editing a route</b>:<br/> Select your route on the "Markers & Routes" page and then select "Edit Route". From here you can add and remove waypoints, as well as editing the name and description of the route.

<b>Sharing a route</b>:<br/> Select your route on the "Markers & Routes" page and then select the option to "Share" using all of the usual share options available to you.

# Nearby Markers

## What is it?

The <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button tells you about up to four markers that are closest to you. <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> is intended to help you orient yourself using places you already know about.

## When would I use it?

When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> to hear about the locations of places you know of.

## How does it work?

As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply, tap the <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button and you will hear up to four markers near you.

# Markers

With Soundscape, you can mark your world and anything you care about.

You can mark things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. You can mark any place or address, but you can also mark things that might traditionally not be available in maps, for example, entrances to buildings or parks, push-to-walk buttons, pedestrian crossings or bridges, bus stops or even your dog’s favorite tree and use these as references along your walk.

To experience marked places, Soundscape will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby markers button at the bottom of the Soundscape home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. In addition, you have the ability to set an audio beacon on any marked place. When you do this, the Soundscape audio beacon you are familiar with, will be heard and you can operate it as usual.

# Creating Markers

You can create markers in three ways: searching for the place you would like to save using the search bar, finding somewhere using the "Places Nearby" button, or using the "Use Current Location" button, all of which can be found on the Soundscape home screen. Once you have found the place you would like, selecting it will take you to the "Location Details" page. On this page, select the button called "Save Marker".

You will now have the option to customize this marker. This step is optional. If you want to, you can change the name of the marker and also add an annotation that will be called out along with the marker to provide some extra information. Once you are done, select the "Done" button to save your Marker. 

# Customizing Markers

If you want to rename a marker you previously created, or add an annotation to it, then you can do so by selecting the marker from the "Markers" tab of the "Markers & Routes" page, then selecting the "Edit Marker" button. You can use this to give markers descriptive or useful nicknames, as well as giving them a longer description using the annotation field.

From this Edit screen, you can also delete a marker if you no longer need it.

# Tips

You can find nearby bus stops by selecting the "Public Transit" filter in the Nearby Places list.

You can set a beacon on any address. From the main Soundscape screen, search for the address. After selecting the address in the search results, a "Location Details" screen will be shown and it has an option to "Start Audio Beacon" on the address. In this way, you can set a beacon on businesses, places, points of interest, and residences that are not in Open Street Maps.

If there is a bus route you take regularly, set your pickup and exit stops as Markers. This way they will be saved so you can find them again easily, just go to "Manage Markers" from the menu and find them in the list. You can set a beacon on them and you will get periodic updates on how close you are to your exit stop. Note: you can turn off the rhythmic sound and you will still get distance updates along the way.

If you put your phone in your pocket and stop moving, the beacon sound will get quieter because Soundscape can’t tell which way you are facing. Solve this by starting to walk again, or pulling your phone out and holding it flat.

Soundscape works best when you hold the phone flat with the screen facing the sky and the top of the phone pointing away from you.

You can turn on and off the rhythmic sound of the beacon using the mute button on the home screen. If the beacon is muted you will still get updates about your distance to your destination every 50 meters or so.

If you still want to interact with Soundscape but don’t want to hear automatic callouts you can turn callouts off by going to the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" page from the menu. Or, if you aren’t going to be using Soundscape you can put it in either Sleep or Snooze mode using the "Sleep" button on the home screen.

# Why is Soundscape working offline?

## Why is Soundscape working offline?

When there is no internet connection or an outage in the Soundscape services, Soundscape transitions into an offline mode. Nevertheless, Soundscape will continue to work, but some functions may be limited.

## Limitations

Callouts will continue to work if you are in an area that you have walked by before and that has been stored in your callout history. Similarly, you can place an audio beacon or create a marker on places that have been stored in your callout history

## What can you do?

Soundscape will try to resume normal operation when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data is enabled and you are in an area with good signal. If your phone does have a good internet connection, but Soundscape does not resume normal operation, then there may be an outage in the Soundscape services.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Soundscape and how should I use it?

### When should I use Soundscape?
Soundscape has features and benefits that span a variety of scenarios and time scales. Furthermore, Soundscape’s value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months. People often think about apps in terms of "what problem is this app good at solving?" Soundscape certainly can be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection. However, the philosophy behind Soundscape is one of "lighting up your world with sound", designed to be used anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing. In this use mode, our users have referred to Soundscape as a "nice companion app", which supports "serendipity", to "fill in the gaps in your mental map" and provide more "confidence when walking". Here are some other examples of how our users are incorporating Soundscape into their life:

"Soundscape helped me get back on track after I got off the bus and headed off in the wrong direction."

"Even in the town where I have lived for 3 years, I have built an improved picture of what is around me [with Soundscape]."

"The 3D sound enhances my experience of a walk, as I feel more connected to my environment…I am more likely to try a new route now that I have the app to use."

"I miss the serendipity of walking around and noticing things. Having Soundscape is nice – it requires no effort to hear about things around me. The relational information is useful and is a great app for situational awareness and exploring commercial corridors."

"[I used Soundscape] to locate a pub in the middle of York. [I] used a range of its options to first locate and then actually find it. It took me to within 3 meters of the door – brilliant!"

### What are Markers and how do I get the most out of them?
Markers are places that you have saved. They could be places that are discoverable within the app, or they could be entirely new places you have added yourself. You can save your current location as a marker by selecting the "Use Current Location" button on the home screen and then selecting "Save as Marker". You can save other locations as a marker by searching for the place you would like to save using the search bar, or finding somewhere using the "Places Nearby" button, both of which can be found on the Soundscape home screen. Once you have found the place you would like, selecting it will take you to the "Location Details" page. On this page, select the button called "Save as Marker".

## How do I get the best out of Soundscape?

### What can I set as a beacon?
You can set an audio beacon on any business, place, point of interest, address, or intersection. There are a few ways you can add a location as a marker. First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar to search for a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", "Saved Markers", or "Current Location" buttons and selecting a location. From the location details screen you can select the "Start Audio Beacon" button. Tapping this will return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you selected. The name of the place you have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will now be displayed on the main app screen.

### How do I use a beacon like a pro?
You can think of the audible beacon as a "lighthouse for the ears", notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic "tacks" to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialized from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the destination, a higher pitched "ring" sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched "ring", hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.

The lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:

1. There is no "correct" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with Soundscape you choose how to get there;
2. The higher pitched "ring" helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;
3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination.

### Why does the audible beacon disappear sometimes?
Soundscape’s audible beacon is fundamentally a directional cue, telling you where your destination is relative to the direction you are facing. When Soundscape is uncertain about what direction you are facing, it lowers the volume of the beacon. Most often this occurs if you have been walking with the phone stored in a pocket or bag, and you stop moving, such as to cross a street. The beacon will get louder once you start moving again, or if you hold the phone flat and point it in the direction you are facing.

### Can I set a beacon on an address?
Yes you can. Addresses are not listed by default but can be found using the search field. To save this address so you don’t need to search for it again, you can add it as a marker from the home screen by selecting the "add to markers" button, or using VoiceOver actions on the beacon on the home screen.

### How do I set a beacon on my home?
Soundscape supports setting beacons on addresses. To set a beacon on your home, or any other address, search for a location from the main Soundscape screen. On the "Location Details" screen, tap the "Start Audio Beacon" button.

### When I set a beacon on a destination, how close will Soundscape get me to the destination? 
Soundscape can determine the location of your destination to within several meters, but not less. When Soundscape determines that you are close to your destination, you will hear a final callout that your destination is nearby, and the beacon will turn off.

### Can I turn the beacon back on when I am close to my destination?
Yes, you can turn the beacon back on once Soundscape turns it off by selecting the "unmute beacon button"; however, since Location Services is only accurate to about 10 meters, we cannot guarantee the behavior of the beacon when you are within a few meters of your destination.

### Why does Soundscape call out road names twice when I approach an intersection?
To accommodate a variety of intersection configurations, Soundscape describes intersections as segments of roadways that depart from a common point. Soundscape uses spatial audio to indicate the name of the road that goes to the left, the name of the road that continues straight ahead, and the name of the road that goes to the right, in that order. If the description of the intersection begins with the road you are on rather than one to the left, then the intersection is a T with the road you are on continuing ahead and a road intersecting from the right. Similarly, if the description only includes a road to the left and to the right, you will know that the road you are on ends at a T ahead of you. This method of describing intersections also supports the case when a road changes name at an intersection.

### Why doesn’t Soundscape announce every business that I pass?
Soundscape is designed not to be too chatty. In addition, it uses Open Street Map as its back-end data source. Open Street Map (OSM, https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a community-developed and edited map of the world, relying on individuals, to enter and curate the data. If a business or point of interest is not announced by Soundscape, the most probable reason is that the business has not been added, or in some cases updated, by a member of the OSM community yet.

### Why do some callouts stop when I'm in a vehicle?
In order to stop the number of callouts becoming overwhelming, some categories, such as intersections, are not announced automatically when you’re traveling in a vehicle.

### What if I don't understand a callout or miss it because of ambient noise?
Soundscape has a list of your recent callouts so that you can revisit callouts that you might have missed. To find this, tap on the search bar on the Soundscape home screen. At the bottom of this page, there is a section for "Recent Callouts" where the callout you missed will be listed.

## How does Soundscape work?

### What phone does Soundscape run on?
Soundscape is currently available for Apple iOS, running on iPhone SE, iPhone 6S and later.

### What headphones should I use with Soundscape?
Which headphones you use with Soundscape is a matter of personal preference, and each option comes with benefits and trade-offs. The only specific requirement is to use a pair of stereo headphones so that you can take advantage of Soundscape’s 3D spatial audio callouts.

### How does Soundscape impact my iPhone’s battery?
Battery life varies significantly depending on which iPhone you own and how old it is. The biggest drain on your battery is having the screen on, so to maximize the battery life of your phone you should keep the screen locked whenever possible. To help minimize the impact on your iPhone battery Soundscape now has a Sleep Mode and a Snooze Mode. To further reduce the amount of battery you use, when you aren’t using Soundscape, you should force close it via your iPhone’s App Switcher. 

### How do I use Sleep Mode to minimize Soundscape’s impact on my phone battery?
To put Soundscape in to Sleep Mode select the "Sleep" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. When you select this Soundscape will stop using Location Services and mobile data until you choose to wake it up again.

### How do I use Snooze mode to minimize Soundscape’s impact on my phone battery?
To put Soundscape in to Snooze Mode select the "Sleep" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. Once Soundscape’s in Sleep mode, select the "Wake up when I leave" button and Soundscape will go in to a low power state until you leave your current location.

### How does my choice of headphones affect the battery life of my phone?
In our tests, the battery consumption of Bluetooth headphones is comparable to wired headphones and should not be a significant factor to consider when selecting headphones. That said, both earbud and bone-conducting headphones have wired and wireless model options.

### How does running Soundscape in the background impact battery life of my phone?
Soundscape is a location-based app and uses Location Services to determine your location. In our tests, Soundscape does not consume any more battery than the average map application; but if you are concerned about battery consumption when using your phone, the following are a few tips which will help lower usage:

1. Turn the screen display off as much as possible when you are not interacting with the app.
2. When not using the app, close it down. Soundscape uses location services continually when it is running so that it always knows your location, even when you are not moving. Don’t forget to restart the app when you resume your journey.
3. In cold weather, keep your phone warm as batteries perform more poorly in colder temperatures.

### How much mobile data does Soundscape use?
The amount of mobile data used depends on how you use Soundscape. We have designed Soundscape to use only a small amount of data when you’re out and about by doing things like saving points as you walk around so you don’t need to download them again every time you go back to somewhere you’ve already been. To reduce the amount of mobile data you use, make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi whenever possible, particularly to download the app. When you are not using Soundscape, you should use the "Sleep" button to put Soundscape to sleep or force close the app.

### How is Soundscape different from other map apps?
Soundscape provides an ambient description of your surroundings in aid of exploration and way-finding. Using spatial audio, Soundscape will call out points of interest, parks, roads, and intersections from the direction they physically are in your immediate environment as you walk. For example, if you pass a shop on your right, you will hear the name of the shop sounding from your right. As you approach an intersection, you will hear each road name sounding from the direction it goes in, beginning to your left, ahead and to the right.

Instead of turn by turn directions as often provided by other map applications, Soundscape will play an audible beacon in the direction of your destination, empowering you to make your way there on your terms using your increased awareness of your surroundings and the location of your destination. Soundscape is designed to run in the background, enabling you to use a turn by turn directions app, all the while continuing to provide environmental awareness as you make your way to your destination.

### How do I use Soundscape with a wayfinding app?
Soundscape is designed as an awareness app to help fill in details about your environment that you may not be aware of otherwise. While it is not designed as a turn-by-turn navigation app, it can be used alongside such apps to provide complementary information. To use Soundscape with these apps, start your navigation app first. Then, move over to Soundscape and set a beacon on the same destination as in the navigation app. At this point, both apps will be running and you will hear walking directions from your navigation app, while getting updates on points of interest, intersections, and your distance to your destination from Soundscape.

### How do I control what I hear and when I hear it in Soundscape?
Soundscape provides several ways to control what you hear and when:

1. Immediately stop all audio: Double tap the screen with two fingers to immediately turn off all audio, including any callout that is currently playing and the beacon if it is on. Callouts will resume automatically when you approach the next intersection or point of interest, but the audible beacon will not. Select the "unmute beacon button" on the main screen to resume hearing the beacon.
2. Stop automatic callouts: When you are not traveling or have reached a destination, you probably will not need Soundscape to continue to notify you of things around you. Instead of exiting the app, you can put Soundscape in to Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put Soundscape into Sleep mode and it will stay off until you choose to turn it back on. Alternatively, you can select "Settings" from the menu and choose to turn all callouts off in the "Manage Callouts" section.
3. Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a destination, but not need the audible beacon on. For example, you may know exactly how to get to your destination but want to get automatic updates about how far away you are from your destination. Or, you may know roughly how to get to your destination, and only need the audio beacon as you near your destination. Whatever the case, you can choose when to hear the beacon by toggling the "mute beacon"/"unmute beacon" button on the main screen.

### Do I need to hold the phone in my hand all the time?
No! While walking you can put the phone away in a bag or pocket or wherever is convenient. Soundscape will use the direction you are walking to figure out which callouts to announce to your left and to your right. When you stop moving, Soundscape does not know which direction you are facing. If the audible beacon is on, you will notice it get quiet until you start moving again. You can pull the phone out to press the location and exploration buttons at the bottom of the screen at any time but make sure to hold the phone with the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing and with the screen to the sky. In this "flat" position, Soundscape will use the phone’s compass to determine which way you are facing and provide accurate spatial callouts. If the beacon is on, you will also notice that it returns to full volume.

### What is Open Street Map and why do we use it for Soundscape?
Soundscape draws on geographic map data to provide the information callouts in the app. The primary map source we use is Open Street Map (www.openstreetmap.org) which is a rich community generated mapping platform, that enables organizations and individuals to improve the quality and granularity of the information provided and the accessibility of their spaces using Open Street Map map authoring tools.
