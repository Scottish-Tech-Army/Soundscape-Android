# Tips

You can find nearby bus stops by selecting the "Public Transit" filter in the Nearby Places list.

You can set a beacon on any address. From the main Soundscape screen, search for the address. After selecting the address in the search results, a "Location Details" screen will be shown and it has an option to "Start Audio Beacon" on the address. In this way, you can set a beacon on businesses, places, points of interest, and residences that are not in Open Street Maps.

If there is a bus route you take regularly, set your pickup and exit stops as Markers. This way they will be saved so you can find them again easily, just go to "Manage Markers" from the menu and find them in the list. You can set a beacon on them and you will get periodic updates on how close you are to your exit stop. Note: you can turn off the rhythmic sound and you will still get distance updates along the way.

If you put your phone in your pocket and stop moving, the beacon sound will get quieter because Soundscape can’t tell which way you are facing. Solve this by starting to walk again, or pulling your phone out and holding it flat.

Soundscape works best when you hold the phone flat with the screen facing the sky and the top of the phone pointing away from you.

You can turn on and off the rhythmic sound of the beacon using the mute button on the home screen. If the beacon is muted you will still get updates about your distance to your destination every 50 meters or so.

If you still want to interact with Soundscape but don’t want to hear automatic callouts you can turn callouts off by going to the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" page from the menu. Or, if you aren’t going to be using Soundscape you can put it in either Sleep or Snooze mode using the "Sleep" button on the home screen.
