# Markers

With Soundscape, you can mark your world and anything you care about.

You can mark things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. You can mark any place or address, but you can also mark things that might traditionally not be available in maps, for example, entrances to buildings or parks, push-to-walk buttons, pedestrian crossings or bridges, bus stops or even your dogâ€™s favorite tree and use these as references along your walk.

To experience marked places, Soundscape will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby markers button at the bottom of the Soundscape home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. In addition, you have the ability to set an audio beacon on any marked place. When you do this, the Soundscape audio beacon you are familiar with, will be heard and you can operate it as usual.
