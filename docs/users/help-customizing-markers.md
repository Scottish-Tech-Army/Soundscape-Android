# Customizing Markers

If you want to rename a marker you previously created, or add an annotation to it, then you can do so by selecting the marker from the *"Markers"* tab of the *"Markers and Routes"* page, then selecting the *"Edit Marker"* button. You can use this to give markers descriptive or useful nicknames, as well as giving them a longer description using the annotation field.

From this Edit screen, you can also delete a marker if you no longer need it.
