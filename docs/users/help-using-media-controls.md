# Using Media Controls

## What is it?

You can access certain features in Soundscape with the help of the media control buttons on your headphones. This functionality works with any wired or Bluetooth headphones that have media control buttons like Play, Pause, Next, Previous and others. Different headphones may include different buttons so please refer to the list of actions below to determine which ones are available to you.

## When would I use it?

Headphone media controls can be used while Soundscape is running. This is true whether you are currently in Soundscape or while Soundscape is in the background and even while your device is locked. Note however that headphone media control buttons will not work with Soundscape if you are playing audio like music, podcasts or videos with another app.

## How does it work?

You can access the following features in Soundscape using your the media control buttons on your headphones:

⏯ Play/Pause: Mute any current callouts and if the audio beacon is set, toggle the beacon audio. 

⏭ Next: Callout *"My Location"*.

⏮ Previous: Repeat last callout.

⏩ Skip Forward: Toggle callouts On and Off.

⏪ Skip Backward: Callout *"Around Me"*.
