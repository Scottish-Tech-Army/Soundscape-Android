# Routes

## What is it?

Routes are a series of waypoints. You will be informed on arrival to each waypoint, and the Audio Beacon will automatically advance to the next waypoint.

## When would I use it?

You may want to create and use a route somewhere you know to make sure you keep on track, or you may want to use it as a tool to help familiarise yourself along a new journey.

## How does it work?

**Creating a route :**

 First, go to *"Markers and Routes"*, select the *"Routes"* tab, and then select the *"New Route"* button. Give the route a name and an optional description, then add waypoints as you go or pick them from your list of Markers. You can rearrange the order of the waypoints along a route at any time by editing the route.

**Editing a route :**

 Select your route on the *"Markers and Routes"* page and then select *"Edit Route"*. From here you can add and remove waypoints, as well as editing the name and description of the route.

**Sharing a route :**

 Select your route on the *"Markers and Routes"* page and then select the option to *"Share"* using all of the usual share options available to you.
