# Why is Soundscape working offline?

## Why is Soundscape working offline?

When there is no internet connection or an outage in the Soundscape services, Soundscape transitions into an offline mode. Nevertheless, Soundscape will continue to work, but some functions may be limited.

## Limitations

Callouts will continue to work if you are in an area that you have walked by before and that has been stored in your callout history. Similarly, you can place an audio beacon or create a marker on places that have been stored in your callout history.

## What can you do?

Soundscape will try to resume normal operation when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data is enabled and you are in an area with good signal. If your phone does have a good internet connection, but Soundscape does not resume normal operation, then there may be an outage in the Soundscape services.
