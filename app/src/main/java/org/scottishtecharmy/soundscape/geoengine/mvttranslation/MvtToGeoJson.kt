/**
 * vectorTileToGeoJson generates a GeoJSON FeatureCollection from a Mapbox Vector Tile.
 * @param tileX is the x coordinate of the tile
 * @param tileY is the y coordinate of the tile
 * @param mvt is the Tile which has been decoded from the protobuf on its way into the application
 * @param cropPoints is a flag to indicate whether or not crop points to be within the tile
 * @param tileZoom defaults to ZOOM_LEVEL but can be forced to 15 to run unit tests even when the
 * backend is not configured to be protomaps.
 *
 * There are really two parts of this function:
 *
 * 1. Iterating over the features in each layers and turning their tags and geometries into GeoJSON.
 * This is done by 'simply' following the [MVT specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1).
 * 2. Adding some locally calculated metadata e.g. the location of intersections, and adding the
 * ability to knit together lines that cross tile boundaries.
 *
 * The input tile geometries are all tile relative and using `tileX` and `tileY` we turn those into
 * latitudes and longitudes for the GeoJSON. Although the locally calculated metadata could be done
 * as a second pass after the initial parsing has been done, it's much more efficient to do them in
 * a single pass. By doing that the geometries are still tile relative and much easier to handle
 * than latitudes and longitudes.
 *
 * The vector tiles come from a protomaps server which is hosting a map file that we generate using
 * `planetiler`. A stock running of `planetiler` is missing some data that we need, so we disable
 * simplification at the maximum zoom level (which is what we're using here) and we also force the
 * addition of a Feature id on all Features within the transportation layer. This allows us to more
 * easily identify roads and paths for intersection handling. We also add a name tag to every
 * feature in the transportation layer. This ensures that we always have an OSM id and a name where
 * there's one available. The `transportation_name` layer is left unused and so its merging of
 * lines to improve the graphical UI is untouched.
 * Note that these changes are  only in our builds and won't be in upstream `planetiler`. None of
 * these changes should affect the graphical rendering of the tiles which is important as we're
 * using the tiles for that too.
 *
 * This means that we only look at 2 layers which are defined here https://openmaptiles.org/schema/:
 *
 * 1. `transportation` contains all footways/roads etc. including named and unnamed and so is a
 * superset of `transportation_name`.  We use the lines from this and along with the names which we
 * added in our custom map.
 * 2. `poi` contains points of interest.
 *
 *
 *
 * Future plans:
 * A Feature is generated for every geometry within a line. There are multiple geometries when a
 * line goes off tile and then comes back on again. All Features for the line have the same contents
 * other than their geometry. The intersections only contain IntersectionDetails which contains
 *
 *     val name : String,
 *     val type : String,
 *     val subClass : String,
 *     val brunnel : String,
 *     val id : Double,
 *     var lineEnd : Boolean
 *
 * which is all that's required for determining if it classifies as an intersection, otherwise it's
 * just a meeting of two segments. When an intersection is created, it has a location and a list of
 * OSM ids. What we really want is:
 *
 *  - Every line between intersections can be a list of Features
 *  - No Feature contains more than 2 intersections i.e. one at each end. Any line which has more
 *  than one intersection is split into multiple Features.
 *
 *  If I'm at an intersection, the Features that connect to it should all be traversable to get to
 *  the next intersection and either the first of last of their string list coordinates should be
 *  the current intersection. The intersection should never be part way along a string - as it
 *  should have been split.
 *
 *  class FeatureMetadata {
 *      // The contents of properties/foreign, but not in a hash map, instead stored in sensible
 *      // format
 *  }
 *
 *  class Way {
 *      val segment: Feature                    // List of Features that make up the way (often just 1)
 *      val length: Double                      // We could easily calculate this from the segments.
 *                                              // It could be useful for context, or for navigation.
 *      val nextIntersection: Intersection      // Link to the intersection at the other end of the
 *                                              // segments
 *
 *      fun getMetadata() : FeatureMetadata     // Returns the metadata for the way, taken from the
 *                                              // first segment. Anything needing OSM ids needs to
 *                                              // be traversing the segments anyway.
 *  }
 *
 *  Should segments contain a List<LineString> rather than Feature and have all the data for Feature
 *  inside the Way instead? If a road is extended with a new OSM id then this would be a problem as
 *  each segment would have a different OSM id. We could merge the segments in the list if the data
 *  is the same, but unsure if that helps much.
 *
 *  class Intersection {
 *      val members: List<Ways>                 // Ways that make up this intersection
 *      val name: String                        // Name of the intersection
 *      val location: LngLatAlt                 // Location of the intersection
 *      val type: Enum                          // Type of intersection:
 *                                              //  REGULAR - a real intersection like we hav now
 *                                              //  JOINER - joins two segments together, skip over
 *                                              //  TILE_EDGE - joins two tiles together, skip over
 *  }
 *
 *  Tile joining. We should have special tile joining intersections. These are like normal
 *  intersections except they are marked to ignore when traversing to the next intersection. The
 *  data in the Features being joined can be slightly tweaked - just moving the coordinates so that
 *  they match i.e. avoiding the 15cm long roads that we currently use to join tiles. When the tile
 *  grid is changed, we can throw away all of these tile joining intersections and recalculate new
 *  ones (some may still be required, so this behaviour could be improved).
 *
 *  Street Preview - this should remove the searching and extending of road lines to find the next
 *  intersection. We should just be able to:
 *  1. Jump immediately to the next intersection or the end of the line (dead-end or tile boundary
 *  that hasn't been joined)
 *  2. If it's a tile joiner, jump through it to the next intersection.
 *  3. Creating the list of ways will be much easier
 *
 *  Name confection - jump through the nextIntersection until we have a REGULAR one and pick a name
 *  from there if there is one.
 *
 *  Routing - We could do routing between intersections fairly easily with all of this data. Instead
 *  of exploding every line into segments as per `explodeLineString` and using every line node,
 *  we can use the intersections as the nodes instead. We can pre-calculate their lengths and store
 *  it in the Way (NOTE: calculating the distance using the tile x/y integer coordinates is likely
 *  accurate enough and more efficient than full blown LngLat calculation). The routing algorithm
 *  can then use the Ways with their length as weights which should be fairly efficient. Most of the
 *  time the user will not be at an intersection and neither will the destination be. But we can
 *  do the calculation from either end of the current Way that we're on and then figure out which
 *  is the shortest route when including the distance to the intersection.
 *
 *  NearestRoad - This data means that we could do a better job via something like this:
 *  https://medium.com/@jabrioussama1/how-to-match-gps-positions-to-roads-b6b13a5e6c20
 *  A good introduction video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChtumoDfZXI
 *  We could keep a short history of GPS locations with their hidden markov states (nearest roads)
 *  and run viterbi on them to find the most likely path that we're on. This relies on the routing
 *  algorithm to give the shortest navigable route between hidden states which is then compared
 *  with the haversine distance. https://github.com/bmwcarit/offline-map-matching/tree/master has
 *  an example implementation.
 *
 *
 *  Implementation - create Features for lines as we do now, but add them to a list inside the
 *  intersection detection class (new addFeature function). The original addLine only has to
 *  increment a node use count, no other details required.
 *  Inside generateIntersections, first traverse every line that was added and generate a new
 *  segment Feature at every intersection that we hit. Add these to Ways as we go. Intersections are spotted using the
 *  coordinate key (x + shr(y)). Put those features in two HashMaps a 'start' an 'end' one, again
 *  keyed by the coordinate key. Once we've traversed all of the lines we should have a Way for
 *  every segment between intersections. Now we generate the intersections and add the Ways directly
 *  to them. Let's do this in a separate class for now so that we can test it.
