Quotes written as \" {NumberedPlaceholder="Soundscape"} -->
  <string name="faq_when_to_use_soundscape_answer">"Soundscape has features and benefits that span a variety of scenarios and time scales. Furthermore, Soundscape’s value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months. People often think about apps in terms of \"what problem is this app good at solving?\" Soundscape certainly can be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection. However, the philosophy behind Soundscape is one of \"lighting up your world with sound\", designed to be used anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing. In this use mode, our users have referred to Soundscape as a \"nice companion app\", which supports \"serendipity\", to \"fill in the gaps in your mental map\" and provide more \"confidence when walking\". Here are some other examples of how our users are incorporating Soundscape into their life:\n\n\"Soundscape helped me get back on track after I got off the bus and headed off in the wrong direction.\"\n\n\"Even in the town where I have lived for 3 years, I have built an improved picture of what is around me [with Soundscape].\"\n\n\"The 3D sound enhances my experience of a walk, as I feel more connected to my environment…I am more likely to try a new route now that I have the app to use.\"\n\n\"I miss the serendipity of walking around and noticing things. Having Soundscape is nice – it requires no effort to hear about things around me. The relational information is useful and is a great app for situational awareness and exploring commercial corridors.\"\n\n\"[I used Soundscape] to locate a pub in the middle of York. [I] used a range of its options to first locate and then actually find it. It took me to within 3 meters of the door – brilliant!\""</string>

<!-- A 'beacon' is an audio signal that helps fix the position of a location - the audio signal is played from the direction of a location which helps navigating towards that direction. 'As the crow flies' is as expression which means roughly 'in a straight line'.'Spatilized' is referring to 'spatial audio' or '3D audio' which is where the audio through your headphones sounds as though it is coming from a given direction, as if it was actually coming from a speaker.

  <string name="faq_how_to_use_beacon_answer">"You can think of the audible beacon as a \"lighthouse for the ears\", notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic \"tacks\" to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialized from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the destination, a higher pitched \"ring\" sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched \"ring\", hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.\n\nThe lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:\n\n1. There is no \"correct\" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with Soundscape you choose how to get there;\n2. The higher pitched \"ring\" helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;\n3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination."</string>

<!-- Callout - a short audio clip with speech and/or sound effect serving as a piece of information. For example, the application can output an audio callout to notify the user that the battery is low. Soundscape - The app that explores the use of innovative audio-based technology to enable people, particularly those with blindness or low vision, to build a richer awareness of their surroundings, thus becoming more confident and empowered to get around by using 3D audio cues to enrich ambient awareness and provide a new way to relate to the environment.

  <string name="faq_holding_phone_flat_answer">"No! While walking you can put the phone away in a bag or pocket or wherever is convenient. Soundscape will use the direction you are walking to figure out which callouts to announce to your left and to your right. When you stop moving, Soundscape does not know which direction you are facing. If the audible beacon is on, you will notice it get quiet until you start moving again. You can pull the phone out to press the location and exploration buttons at the bottom of the screen at any time but make sure to hold the phone with the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing and with the screen to the sky. In this \"flat\" position, Soundscape will use the phone’s compass to determine which way you are facing and provide accurate spatial callouts. If the beacon is on, you will also notice that it returns to full volume."</string>

Callout - a short audio clip with speech and/or sound effect serving as a piece of information. For example, the application can output an audio callout to notify the user that the battery is low. 'Nearby Markers' is the name of one of the buttons in the app. 'Voiceover' is an iPhone feature to help people who are visually impaired use the iPhone. 'Audio Ducking' is the name of an accessibility feature on the iPhone which reduces the volume of an app while 'Voiceover' is speaking. 'Touch ID' is the name of the iPhone feature for unlocking your phone using your finger print. 'Face ID' is the name of the iPhone feature for unlocking your phone using your face. 'Passcode' and 'iPhone Unlock' are all names of sections in the iPhone 'Settings' app. 'My Location', 'Around Me' and 'Ahead of Me' are buttons in the Soundscape app. {NumberedPlaceholder="Soundscape", "VoiceOver","Touch ID", "Face ID","iOS"} -->
  <string name="faq_personalize_experience_answer">"Soundscape allows you to customize three key aspects of the callouts you hear as you are walking:\n\n1. Voice: You can choose which of the available voices on iOS you would like Soundscape to use, as well as the speed at which callouts are spoken. From the Menu, select Settings, then Voice to adjust the Speaking Rate and Voice settings. Additional voices and enhanced voices with a higher quality can be downloaded in the iOS Settings app at Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices. \n2. Distance Metric: Soundscape allows you to hear all distances in either feet or meters. From the Menu, select Settings. The Units of Measure section allows you to toggle between two options: Imperial (feet) and Metric (meters).\n3. Markers: You can mark your world with anything you care about. You can mark things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. Then Soundscape will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby Markers button at the bottom of the Soundscape home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. These markers will remain personal to you and will not be available to anyone else.\n\nIn addition to the above, the following VoiceOver settings can influence how Soundscape behaves:\n\n1. VoiceOver Tips: When VoiceOver tips are turned ON, you will hear more information about all the buttons on the primary Soundscape screen. You can turn on VoiceOver tips by navigating to the iOS Settings app and going to Accessibility > VoiceOver > Verbosity, and turning the Speak Hints setting on.\n2. Audio Ducking: Soundscape is designed to work with Audio Ducking turned OFF. When Audio Ducking is on, automatic callouts can be difficult to hear if VoiceOver is used simultaneously. We recommend turning Audio Ducking off to make it easier to hear all automatic callouts that occur as you are interacting with the phone. Audio ducking can be turned off in VoiceOver settings or via the VoiceOver rotor.\n3. Touch ID or Face ID to Unlock: Setting your phone to unlock using Touch ID or Face ID will make unlocking the phone fast and easy, and in turn, allow you to access the My Location, Around Me, and Ahead of Me buttons as quickly as possible when you are on the go. Set up Touch ID or Face ID unlocking in the iOS Settings app."</string>
