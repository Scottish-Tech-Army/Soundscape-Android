  Text for HTML section: 'Setting a beacon is useful when you want to keep track of a familiar landmark as you explore a new area or when you are going somewhere and want to be informed about your surroundings along the way. The beacon feature does not give you turn-by-turn directions, but it does give you a continuous audible sound that tells you the direction to the beacon, relative to where you are currently located. Using the audio beacon, your existing wayfinding skills, and even your favorite navigation app, you can choose how you want to get to nearby locations yourself.
