  Text for HTML section: 'You can think of the audible beacon as a *"lighthouse for the ears"*, notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic *"tacks"* to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialized from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the destination, a higher pitched *"ring"* sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched *"ring"*, hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.
The lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:
1. There is no *"correct"* direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with Soundscape you choose how to get there;
2. The higher pitched *"ring"* helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;
3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination.'
