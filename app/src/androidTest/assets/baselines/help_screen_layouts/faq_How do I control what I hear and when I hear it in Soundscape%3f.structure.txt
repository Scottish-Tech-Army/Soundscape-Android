Text for HTML section: 'Soundscape provides several ways to control what you hear and when: 1. Immediately stop all audio: Double tap the screen with two fingers to immediately turn off all audio, including any callout that is currently playing and the beacon if it is on. Callouts will resume automatically when you approach the next intersection or point of interest, but the audible beacon will not. Select the *"unmute beacon button"* on the main screen to resume hearing the beacon. 2. Stop automatic callouts: When you are not traveling or have reached a destination, you probably will not need Soundscape to continue to notify you of things around you. Instead of exiting the app, you can put Soundscape in to Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put Soundscape into Sleep mode and it will stay off until you choose to turn it back on. Alternatively, you can select *"Settings"* from the menu and choose to turn all callouts off in the *"Manage Callouts"* section. 3. Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a destination, but not need the audible beacon on. For example, you may know exactly how to get to your destination but want to get automatic updates about how far away you are from your destination. Or, you may know roughly how to get to your destination, and only need the audio beacon as you near your destination. Whatever the case, you can choose when to hear the beacon by toggling the *"mute beacon"*/*"unmute beacon"* button on the main screen.'
