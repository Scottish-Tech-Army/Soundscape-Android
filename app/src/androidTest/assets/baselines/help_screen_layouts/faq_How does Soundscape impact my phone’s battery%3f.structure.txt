Text for HTML section: 'Battery life varies significantly depending on which phone you own and how old it is. The biggest drain on your battery is having the screen on, so to maximize the battery life of your phone you should keep the screen locked whenever possible. To help minimize the impact on your phone battery Soundscape now has a Sleep Mode. To further reduce the amount of battery you use, when you aren’t using Soundscape, you should force close it via your phones App Switcher.'
