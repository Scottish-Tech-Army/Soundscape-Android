  Text for HTML section: 'To accommodate a variety of intersection configurations, Soundscape describes intersections as segments of roadways that depart from a common point. Soundscape uses spatial audio to indicate the name of the road that goes to the left, the name of the road that continues straight ahead, and the name of the road that goes to the right, in that order. If the description of the intersection begins with the road you are on rather than one to the left, then the intersection is a T with the road you are on continuing ahead and a road intersecting from the right. Similarly, if the description only includes a road to the left and to the right, you will know that the road you are on ends at a T ahead of you. This method of describing intersections also supports the case when a road changes name at an intersection.'
