Text for HTML section: 'The amount of mobile data used depends on how you use Soundscape. We have designed Soundscape to use only a small amount of data when you’re out and about by doing things like saving points as you walk around so you don’t need to download them again every time you go back to somewhere you’ve already been. To reduce the amount of mobile data you use, make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi whenever possible, particularly to download the app. When you are not using Soundscape, you should use the *"Sleep"* button to put Soundscape to sleep or force close the app.'
