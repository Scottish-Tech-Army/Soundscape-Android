Text for HTML section: 'Soundscape provides an ambient description of your surroundings in aid of exploration and way-finding. Using spatial audio, Soundscape will call out points of interest, parks, roads, and intersections from the direction they physically are in your immediate environment as you walk. For example, if you pass a shop on your right, you will hear the name of the shop sounding from your right. As you approach an intersection, you will hear each road name sounding from the direction it goes in, beginning to your left, ahead and to the right. Instead of turn by turn directions as often provided by other map applications, Soundscape will play an audible beacon in the direction of your destination, empowering you to make your way there on your terms using your increased awareness of your surroundings and the location of your destination. Soundscape is designed to run in the background, enabling you to use a turn by turn directions app, all the while continuing to provide environmental awareness as you make your way to your destination.'
